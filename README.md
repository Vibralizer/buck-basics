## What's Included

### Extension Methods

Over several projects, BUCK has collected many useful extension methods that are applicable to a wide variety of scenarios. These are available in the `Buck` namespace in the [`ExtensionMethods`](Runtime/ExtensionMethods.cs) class. Here are some highlights:

- [`void Shuffle(IList<T> list)`](https://github.com/buck-co/unity-pkg-buck-basics/blob/main/Runtime/ExtensionMethods.cs#L11) - Effectively randomizes the order of elements in a C# List using the [Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle) algorithm.
- [`T[,] Rotate90<T>(T[,] arr)`](https://github.com/buck-co/unity-pkg-buck-basics/blob/main/Runtime/ExtensionMethods.cs#L174) - Returns a 2D array that has been rotated 90 degrees CW. There are numerous other array manipulation methods like this one that can transpose rows, columns, and more.
- [`bool IsVisibleFrom(Renderer renderer, Camera camera)`](https://github.com/buck-co/unity-pkg-buck-basics/blob/main/Runtime/ExtensionMethods.cs#L112) - Returns true if a Renderer is visible from the provided Camera.
- [`Vector2 RandomPointOnUnitCircle()`](https://github.com/buck-co/unity-pkg-buck-basics/blob/main/Runtime/ExtensionMethods.cs#L328) - Returns a random point on a unit circle.
- [`Color Tint(Color value, float tint)`](https://github.com/buck-co/unity-pkg-buck-basics/blob/main/Runtime/ExtensionMethods.cs#L306) - Adds a tint to a Color.
- [`Transform NearestTransform(Transform origin, List<Transform> positions)`](https://github.com/buck-co/unity-pkg-buck-basics/blob/main/Runtime/ExtensionMethods.cs#L346) - Given a list of Transforms, return the one that is nearest to an origin Transform.
- [`float Smootherstep(float from, float to, float x)`](https://github.com/buck-co/unity-pkg-buck-basics/blob/main/Runtime/ExtensionMethods.cs#L397) - [Ken Perlin's better smooth step](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothstep#Variations) with 1st and 2nd order derivatives at x = 0 and 1.

Extension methods can be used in two ways. You can use the methods directly from the class.

```cs
// Remap a value from a min and max to the 0-1 range
float myValue = Buck.ExtensionMethods.Remap01(originalVar, minValue, maxValue);
```

Alternatively, you can call extension methods on existing types. For example, there are several methods that extend Unity's Color class.

```cs
// Set the alpha value of a color.
Color myTransparentColor = myColor.SetAlpha(0.5f);
```

### Scriptable Objects for Variables, Events, and Runtime Sets

Several Unity projects at BUCK make heavy use of variables and events that are built on Unity's [`ScriptableObject`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-ScriptableObject.html) class. In other words, the variables and events have associated Scriptable Object assets that then store their values at runtime. There are numerous benefits to this approach, but generally speaking, it allows for data to be shared between MonoBehaviour components without hard coded object references. This tends to help avoid a tangled mess of component dependencies and numerous static singleton classes.

This is a fairly involved subject, but fortunately it's already well documented in several places, [most notably in this Unite Austin 2017 talk from its creator, Ryan Hipple of Schell Games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raQ3iHhE_Kk). We strongly recommend you watch this video before attempting to use SO Variables and Events in a production project.

Our unique approach collapses Scriptable Object Variables and Events together. Every Variable type inherits from a GameEvent base, allowing you to subscribe GameEventListeners to whenever that variable changes. In addition, each variable type is paired with a Reference object class that can be added to the inspector. This 

We also support a wide variety of Variable types. There is also a base class for NumberVariables and VectorVariables that more specific types inherit from.
* BoolVariable
* NumberVariable base class
  * IntVariable
  * FloatVariable
  * DoubleVariable
* VectorVariable base class
  * Vector2Variable
  * Vector3Variable
  * Vector4Variable
  * Vector2IntVariable
  * Vector3IntVariable
* QuaternionVariable
* StringVariable
* GameObjectVariable
* ColorVariable
* Texture2DVariable
* SpriteVariable
* MaterialVariable

All variables can be created by right clicking in the `Project> Create > BUCK > Variables`. Once created a Default Value can be assigned. This is the value the variable will begin with each time you enter the play mode.

You can reference a Variable in a script with:
```cs
[SerializeField] IntVariable m_intVariable;//Fill reference in editor
```

Then read or write the variables value as follows:
```cs
    if (m_intVariable.Value > 0)
    {
        m_intVariable.Value -= 10;
        m_intVariable.Raise();//Notify any listeners to the IntVariable event that it has changed
    }
```

### Variable References

Each supported Scriptable Object variable is also paired with an equivalent (NAMEOFVARIABLE)Reference class. These classes can be used to create Inspector fields in the editor that can either reference a Scriptable Object or a constant equivalent variable. This is usually the best way to reference variables while writing code since it offers more flexibility than directly referencing a Scriptable Object variable. References are heavily used  for the Condition and Operator classes. References for base types also exist (NumberReference and VectorReference) and offer even more flexibility, although each assumes a particular type when used as a constant. NumberReferences use floats as their constant and VectorReferences use Vector4s.

To create a reference simply create a new field for it then edit it in the editor:
```cs
[SerializeField] NumberReference m_numberReference;
```

### Operations

Operations are an extension of our Scriptable Object variable systems that allow you to execute some common operations upon a subset of our Variable types. It approximates writing a single line of code while being entirely editor facing and requiring no actual scripting. The three supported operations are as follows:
* BoolOperation
  * Set To and Toggle
* NumberOperation
  * Set To, Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Pow
  * If acting on an IntVariable supports rounding: RoundToInt, FloorToInt, and CeilToInt
* VectorOperation
  * Set To, Addition, Subtraction, Scalar Multiplication, Scalar Division

Every Operation has a BoolReference RaiseEvent field that if true, will raise the GameEvent of the A variable in the operation and notify all of its listeners of the change. Typically this is the behaviour you want, but in special situations you may want to change this to false to "silently" edit a variable.

To use an Operation, create a new field for a single Operation or a collection of muliple Operations with the following:
```cs
[SerializeField] BoolOperation m_boolOperation;//Single operation
[SerializeField] VectorOperation[] m_multipleVectorOperations;//A collection of multiple operations to execute all together
```

Then edit them in the Inspector. Finally, execute them with the following:
```cs
m_boolOperation.Execute();//Execute the one operation
m_multipleVectorOperations.Execute();//Executes all operations within the collection in order
```

### Conditions

Similar to Operations, Conditions allow you to set up conditional boolean logic as if you are writing an if statemenmt but define it in editor without editing scripts. Unlike Operations, the Condition class is flexible and one class serves Bool, Number, and Vector comparisons. To switch between what type you are comparing use the VariableType enum dropdown. The supported comparisons and their symbol equivalent are as follows:

* Equal To (==)
* Not Equal To (!=)
* Less Than (<)
* Less Than or Equal To (<=)
* Greater Than (>)
* Greater Than or Equal To (>=)

If using a Condition that imply a numeric value (Less Than or Greater Than for example), variables that are not inheritly numbers are treated as followsL: BoolReferences are cast to 0  (false) or 1 (true). VectorReferences calculate their magnitudes and use that to compare.

To use a Condition, create a new field for a single Condition or a collection of multiple Operations with the following. Then edit them in the Inpsector.
```cs
[SerializeField] NumberCondition m_numberCondition;//Single condition
[SerializeField] BoolCondition[] m_multipleBoolConditions;//A collection of multiple conditions to execute all together
```

Then edit them in the Inpsector. Finally, evaluate them with the following code:
```cs
if (m_numberCondition.PassCondition)
{
    //Do something if the number condition is true
}

if (m_multipleBoolConditions.PassConditions())
{
    //Do something if all of the BoolConditions in the collection are true (if any single condition  fails, PassConditions() return false)
}
```


### Singleton Class

While the Scriptable Object based architecture mentioned above can help avoid Singletons and some of the bad practices that can stem from them (single instances of a class, strong connections between classes, dependency spaghetti, and more), sometimes the [singleton pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern) is still too convenient to ignore, especially during any rapid prototyping phases of a project. We've reviewed many different singleton implementations in C# around the web, and [this one](https://github.com/buck-co/unity-pkg-buck-basics/blob/main/Runtime/Utility/Singleton.cs) seems to be the de facto standard. We've used it on several projects and it seems to work very well. While this exact implementation can be found in many places, we're unsure of its origins, so if you know whom to credit for this, please let us know!
  
  
### BaseScriptableObject Class
  
Many of our Scriptable Object types inherit from our [`BaseScriptableObject`](https://github.com/buck-co/unity-pkg-buck-basics/blob/main/Runtime/Utility/BaseScriptableObject.cs) class. The primary reason for this is so that we can attach a [GUID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.guid?view=net-7.0) (globally unique identifier) to any of our Scriptable Objects (SO). The GUID attached to an SO will not change, which makes them useful for comparisons and for finding duplicate items in a list, for example. The `BaseScriptableObject` class also has associated methods like [FindByGuid<T>()](https://github.com/buck-co/unity-pkg-buck-basics/blob/main/Runtime/Utility/BaseScriptableObject.cs#L25) that make it easier to find a subset of a given SO type on disk.
  
  
### Object Pooling
  
We cultivated our own [`ObjectPooler`](https://github.com/buck-co/unity-pkg-buck-basics/blob/main/Runtime/Utility/ObjectPooler.cs) class over several projects, following as many Unity best practices as we could find for [object pooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_pool_pattern), and put them into one place. This class also has a companion class, [`PoolerIdentifier`](https://github.com/buck-co/unity-pkg-buck-basics/blob/main/Runtime/Utility/ObjectPooler.cs), which is a MonoBehaviour component that gets attached to any object created by the object pooler. This way, if another script needs to grab a pooled object and potentially recycle it back to its original object pooler, it can identify the pooler from which the object was generated. This allows pooled objects to be instantiated anywhere in the Unity hierarchy without relying on their parent GameObject for identification.
  
### Sample Project

A Sample Project is available and can optionally be imported using the Package manager. It demonstrates the use of Variables, Events, Conditions, and Operations to simulate some RPG like mechanics. The sample scene file is called `_BuckBasicsSampleScene`.
